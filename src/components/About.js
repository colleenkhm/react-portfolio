    <p>I developed an interest in language-learning at a young age, which
            took me from studying Spanish, French, and ASL throughout high
            school to graduating from Lawrence University with a Bachelor's
            degree in Linguistics and Classical Languages & Literature. After dedicating a year to national volunteer service through AmeriCorps I worked two part-time jobs, one as a barista and one as a bartender, while exploring potential career opportunities. I quickly discovered coding to be the intersection of language, creativity, and logic I had sought after for so long and eventually went on to obtain a Full Stack Web Development Certificate through Washington University in St. Louis. I currently work as a software engineer for an ecommerce site trafficked in over 140 countries, though I am open to opportunities that more closely align with my interests whether it be in language, education, or artistry.</p>
